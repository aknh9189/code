**Sudoko Solver v1.0**
	This little(ish) python script solves sudoko puzzles! The puzzles are easy to input using 2d arrays. The program uses a crude “brute force” method, by finding all the possible solutions for each column and plugging them in until all of the rows fit together.

**TODO**
 - use a more reflexive method of solving by narrowing down the pool of possible solutions.
- cross check the proposed grid solutions vs the proposed row/column overlap.
- try and speed up checking time if still required.
