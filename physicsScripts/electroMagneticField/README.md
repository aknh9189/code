**Electromagnetic Field Visualizer V1.0**

Allows the visualization of electromagnetic fields generated  by point charges. Displays a colormap or vector map of proincharges in a 1 meter by 1 meter grid. Resolution is settable. 
Remove %matplotlib inline if not running with ipython notebook
Both .py and .ipynb provided. 

Enjoy!

**TODO**

-Add option to do colormap to show magnitude and vectors to show direction, which would be the best of both options. 

-Add an option to easily change the square area (right now set to 1m by 1m)
